# 🌦️ Weather Prediction System — Deep Learning Model

## 📘 Project Description

The **Weather Prediction System** is a Deep Learning-based project that predicts the type of weather (Rain, Drizzle, Fog, Sun, or Snow) using meteorological features such as **precipitation, temperature, and wind speed**.
Built with a **Sequential Neural Network**, this model achieves around **82% accuracy**, making it a robust baseline for short-term weather classification tasks.

## 🔍 About the Project

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to real-world meteorological data to predict weather conditions.
It uses historical Seattle weather data and applies data preprocessing, normalization, model training, and evaluation to classify weather types accurately.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is a **Sequential Neural Network** built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, consisting of:

* **Input Layer:** Features — `precipitation`, `temp_max`, `temp_min`, and `wind`
* **Hidden Layers:** Fully connected `Dense` layers using **ReLU** activation
* **Output Layer:** Uses **Softmax** activation for multi-class classification
* **Optimizer:** **Adam**
* **Loss Function:** **Categorical Cross-Entropy**
* **Metric:** **Accuracy**

The model uses **argmax** on the final predictions to determine the most probable weather class.

| `precipitation` | Daily precipitation (mm)                                      |
| `temp_max`      | Maximum temperature (°C)                                      |
| `temp_min`      | Minimum temperature (°C)                                      |
| `wind`          | Wind speed (m/s)                                              |
| `weather`       | Categorical weather condition (rain, drizzle, fog, sun, snow) |

The target variable **`weather`** is label-encoded before training.
