# DL_Project_Weather_Prediction_System

Developed a Deep Learning model for weather prediction using a Sequential Neural Network with inputs â€” precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, and wind. Optimized using Adam and trained with cross-entropy loss, the model achieved 82% accuracy. It classifies weather conditions into rain, drizzle, fog, sun, or snow, using argmax for final class label prediction.
